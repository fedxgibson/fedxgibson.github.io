# Hello! Thanks for visiting.

Hi, I'm Fede, and I have been working in tech for the last 10 years. I started as a developer in software agencies and have just made the transition to a product company.

According to the Myers-Briggs personality test, I'm an **INTJ**â€”an introvert who makes decisions using logic, not feelings. I thrive on structure, planning, and organization, and I prefer to work with abstract ideas and patterns rather than concrete facts.  

Based on the **Big Five personality traits**, I score:  
- **High** in openness and conscientiousness  
- **Low** in extraversion  
- **High** in agreeableness and neuroticism  

## Topics That Fascinate Me  

- **Psychology** â€“ Being high in neuroticism, studying psychology has been instrumental in living life more effectively. I've explored fields like Somatic Experiencing, psychoanalysis, and cognitive behavioral therapy.  
- **Astrophysics** â€“ I have forever been fascinated by the sky, and theories regarding black holes interest me tremendously.  
- **Engineering** â€“ Having access to a computer at a young age in life influenced my decision to pursue engineering as a career.  
- **Economics** â€“ This is a relatively new interest of mine. Given its deep impact on the world, I figured it was worth understanding.  
- **Investments** â€“ High neuroticism makes the uncertainty of the future seem overwhelming, so I began researching investing.  
- **Business** â€“ My interest in economics and investing naturally extended to business. I'm currently studying valuation investing through Aswath Damodaran's teachings.  
- **Fitness** â€“ Living in a world of ideas creates a need for something tangible. Fitness became my grounding force, so I studied nutrition and the science of muscle development.  
- **Music** â€“ I've been involved in music since I was a kid. I started with the guitar, completed a two-year harmony course covering classical to jazz, and I'm now teaching myself how to play the piano. I also love singing.

I hope you find value in what I share here. **Happy reading!** ðŸ˜Š
