Hello! Thanks for visiting.

I'm Fede and I've been working in tech for 10 years now. I started working as a developer in software agencies and I currently switch to a product based company.

I'm an INTJ according to Myers Briggs personality test. When I first hear about my personality type, suddenly a lot of things started to make sense to me. I focus a lot on internal 


 I'm an introvert, I'm curious with concepts, patterns and search for meaning in everything I do, 

.I'm always trying to optimize processes around me to make my life and those around me easier.
I tend to have a growth oriented mindset, that's why I dedicate some time to read books to get new ideas I can test in the real world.
I'm also all about learning from people around me. Anyone can be a teacher in some way or another, so having a humble attitude is key.

Hope you enjoy being around here and that I can provide you with some value. Happy reading :)
